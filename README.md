# Shopping List App

A simple shopping list app built with React, shadcn/ui, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Designed to be deployed to Cloudflare Pages with a D1 SQL database for list persistence. The front-end was iteratively designed from a template by [dyad](https://dyad.sh/), with help from Claude to build more customized interactions and responsive features.
